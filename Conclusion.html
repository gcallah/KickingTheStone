            Michael Oakeshott once said that reality is "not
            whatever I happen to think; it is what I am obliged to think". And for
            Berkeley, what one is "obliged to think" are the thoughts in the mind of God.
            The question any idealist metaphysics must face is, "Why do we seem to perceive
            a common reality with certain intractable features?" Berkeley may not have
            answered that question in a completely satisfactory way, and perhaps other
            idealists have done better. But he did provide an answer, and that answer is
            why, in his view, (human) experience is not "radically subjective", but is an
            objective world of ideas.

            Hilary Putnam, in <i>Renewing Philosophy</i>, discusses the
            final arrival of esteemed analytical philosopher Nelson Goodman at a sort of
            radical relativism: "But if we choose to speak of worlds, where do these worlds
            come from? Goodman's answer is unequivocal: they are made by us. They are not
            made <i>ex nihilo</i>, but out of previous worlds... Springing full-blown
            within contemporary analytic philosophy, a form of idealism as extreme as Hegel's
            or Fichte's!" (1992: 111)
            </p>

            Never mind that Putnam is almost certainly misreading Hegel and
            Fichte; his point is important nonetheless. I would not wish to suggest for a
            moment that Berkeley is the last word in metaphysics. If, for instance, someone
            rejects his concept of God, Berkeley's basis for the objective reality of the
            world goes with it. But he was surely correct in arguing that it was the posit
            of an un-sensed matter, without color, texture, warmth, tone, feel, or
            character, a "something we know not what"&#8212;what Whitehead called a
            "vacuous actuality" (1969: 193)&#8212;that pointed the way down the road to
            skepticism.
