                Johnson
            </h3>

            <p>
            One of the early, notable misunderstandings of Berkeley was that of Samuel
            Johnson. A famous incident where Johnson took on Berkeley is described by
            Boswell, his biographer:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
            After we came out of the church, we stood talking for some
            time together of Bishop Berkeley's ingenious sophistry to prove the
            non-existence of matter, and that every thing in the universe is merely ideal.
            I observed, that though we are satisfied his doctrine is not true, it is
            impossible to refute it. I never shall forget the alacrity with which Johnson
            answered, striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone, till he
            rebounded from it, "I refute it <i>thus</i>." (1952: 129)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
            In another passage relating to Berkeley, Boswell writes:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
            Being in company with a gentleman who thought fit to maintain
            Dr. Berkeley's ingenious philosophy, that nothing exists but as perceived by
            some mind; when the gentleman was going away, Johnson said to him, "Pray, Sir,
            don"t leave us; for we may perhaps forget to think of you, and then you will
            cease to exist." (1952: 442)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
            Of course, both of these episodes egregiously misunderstand Berkeley's
            position. As we saw above in the passages where Berkeley discusses the
            importance of the body to our overall well-being, and where he touts the health
            benefits of tar water, he in no way denied the reality of bodily phenomena. It
            would not have been of any surprise to him that Johnson"s foot bounced off of a
            large stone, or that Johnson"s "refutation" hurt him more than it impacted
            Berkeley's actual views. The idea that other conscious beings would "cease to
            exist" if Johnson was not thinking of them is obviously an even sillier
            interpretation of Berkeley, because spiritual beings for him are minds and thus
            do not need to be "in mind" to exist.
            </p>

            <p>
            Bruce Silver (1993) attempts to defend Boswell"s
            interpretation of this incident, but as his effort rests on the notion that
            Berkeley was a "subjective idealist", the conclusions of this paper (and
            numerous other Berkeley scholars) undermine this defense of Boswell.

        <h3>
            Kant
        </h3>

            <p>
            Two towering philosophers are probably most
            responsible for the common misinterpretation of Berkeley among the
            philosophically educated: Kant and Hegel. Let us first turn to Kant, whose
            Berkeley is an idealist bogeyman having little to do with Berkeley's actual
            views. Kant claims that Berkeley is a "dogmatic idealist", by which he means:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                Idealism&#8212;meaning thereby <i>material</i>
            idealism&#8212;is the theory which declares the existence of objects in space
            outside us either to be merely doubtful and indemonstrable or to be false and
            impossible... the latter is the <i>dogmatic</i> idealism of Berkeley. He
            maintains that space, with all the things of which it is the inseparable
            condition, is something which is in itself impossible; and he therefore regards
            the things in space as merely imaginary entities. (1965: 244)
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
            Kant believes that idealism such as Berkeley's puts
            things perceived "inside the mind", whereas his critical philosophy corrects
            this by placing them outside it:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                Thus perception of this permanent is possible only through
            a <i>thing</i> outside me; and consequently the determination of my existence
            in time is possible only through the existence of actual things which I
            perceive outside me...Idealism assumed that the only immediate experience is
            inner experience, and that from it we can only infer outer things... But in the
            above proof it has been shown that outer experience is really immediate... (1965:
            245-246)
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
            But Berkeley's understanding of the nature of our
            perceptions implies that they are not "inner experience" but publicly accessible;
            as Pappas writes:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                I know of no reason to think that Berkeley is committed to
            holding that each idea is private in the sense described. After all, any idea
            immediately perceived by a finite perceiver is also immediately perceived by
            God. So, Berkeley is committed to the contrary line, viz., that ideas are
            publicly perceivable entities. (1982: 9)
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
            Kant again attempts to differentiate himself from
            Berkeleyean idealism in that he does not doubt "the existence of things": "My
            idealism concerns not the existence of things (to doubting of which, however,
            constitutes idealism in the ordinary sense)..." (2001: 34). But here is what
            Berkeley actually says on this very point: "I might as well doubt of my own
            being as of the being of those things I actually see and feel" (1996: 173).</p>
            
            <p>
            Or consider what Kant says about Berkeley and the senses:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                The dictum of all genuine
            idealists, from the Eleatic school to Bishop Berkeley, is contained in the
            formula: "All cognition through the senses and experience is nothing but sheer
            illusion..." (2001: 107).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
            Or this:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                experience, according to Berkeley, can have no criteria of
            truth because its appearances (according to him) have nothing <i>a priori</i>
            at their foundation, whence it follows that experience is nothing but sheer
            illusion... (2001: 108).
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
            Once again, compare these to what Berkeley actually
            wrote: "Let me be represented as one who trusts his senses, who thinks he knows
            the things he sees and feels, and entertains no doubts of their existence..." (1996:
            180)</p>
            
            <p>
            It is hard to see how any description of Berkeley's views
            could be further from Berkeley's views than is Kant's. But what is the cause of
            this vast gulf between what Berkeley wrote and what Kant wrote about what
            Berkeley wrote? Some have concluded that Kant was almost completely unfamiliar
            with Berkeley's works and was relying on hearsay. (Colin Turbayne, 1955, in his
            first footnote, cites five prominent sources forwarding this view.)</p>
            
            <p>
            In an intriguing alternate hypothesis, Turbayne first demonstrates
            that Kant and Berkeley are actually quite close in their critique of the
            Lockean concept of matter. Turbayne continues to note that, for both Berkeley
            and Kant:</p>
            
            <blockquote>The distinction between reality and illusion retains its
            full force. Its criterion is not the futile correspondence of our ideas with
            external archetypes, but merely their coherence within our experience. In
            effect, there are no illusions of sense, only delusions of the understanding,
            because the senses tell no lies. Kant declares, "It is not the senses, however,
            which must be charged with the illusion, but the understanding" (Proleg. 13).
            Error occurs on the level of judgment. (1955: 236)</blockquote>
            
            <p>
            The difference between the two in this respect is that for
            Berkeley the objective basis of what we term "reality" is its existence in the
            mind of God, whereas for Kant it lies in the transcendental object. (We might
            suspect that Kant's basis is not an improvement on Berkeley's, given the
            mysterious nature of "the thing in itself".)</p>
            
            <p>
            Turbayne notes how Kant's main critique of Berkeley fails:</p>
            
            <blockquote>It is the existence of the things behind the appearances,
            causing these appearances in us, which makes Kant's doctrine 'the very
            contrary' of idealism. Berkeley's idealism fails because it denies, not the
            existence of bodies in space, but things-in-themselves. This recourse is completely
            out of line with the other 'refutations ', and indeed, with the Critical
            philosophy. The illegitimate appeal to this criterion, coming as it does, just
            after Kant had read the Garve-Feder review [which was critical of the first
            edition of <i>The Critique of Pure Reason</i>], gives the impression of
            desperation. (1955: 238)
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
            Then he declares Berkeley and Kant to be the
            pre-eminent anti-sceptics:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Finally, in their refutation of dogmatic idealism (the
            deepest scepticism) with its attendant proof of an external world, they leave
            the whole field far behind. Berkeley's refutation of scepticism, with his
            parallel vindication of common-sense, was one of his main aims. (1955:
            239)
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
            What, then, are we to make of Kant's hostility to
            Berkeley's philosophy? Turbayne continues:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>
                Clearly, Berkeley did not deny the reality of the sensible
            word; Kant says that he did. Such gross misinterpretation surely indicates
            profound mis-understanding. However, this first set of facts, when properly
            assessed and interpreted, yields a contrary view. (1955: 240)
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
            This "gross misinterpretation" can be explained as
            follows:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>Kant's official view does seem to arise from a
            misconception of Berkeley's doctrine, and therefore to stem from ignorance.
            This accords with the accepted theory. However, such a theory loses weight
            immediately, when it is pointed out that Kant rarely agrees with anyone, and
            that his customary procedure in discussing the views of other philosophers, is
            to present, not their real views, but rather the consequences he considers to be
            entailed by them. These Kantian consequences are then ascribed to the
            philosophers as their own views. (1955: 240)</blockquote>
            
            <p>
            There is a genuine difference between Kant's and
            Berkeley's view of the real basis of the sensory world, but it consists in a
            fine philosophical distinction as to the nature of space:</p>
            
            <p>
                Here we see that Kant departs from
            Berkeley's view, not on the question of the ideality of space and its
            appearances, but on its <i>a priori</i> nature.
            The distinction between <i>ideality</i>
            and the <i>a priori</i> (often neglected by authorities) is clarified in this
            passage. Kant agrees with Berkeley that space is ideal, but whereas the latter
            holds that it is learned from experience, Kant holds he has proved that "it
            inheres in us as a pure form of our sensibility before all perception or
            experience". Because of this, it can afford the certain criterion for
            distinguishing truth from illusion therein. (1955: 242)
            </p>
            
            <p>
            As a result of this difference, Kant concludes that
            Berkeley <i>ought</i> to believe that physical objects are illusory:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>
                Kant thus holds that illusion is a necessary consequence of
            Berkeley's view, not that it is Berkeley's view. His highly significant
            admission makes it more than likely that Kant's repeated assertions elsewhere
            to the effect that Berkeley actually believes in dogmatic idealism are
            instances of Kant's habit of ascribing to other philosophers what are, in fact,
            consequences drawn by Kant himself. It follows that Kant's knowledge of
            Berkeley's philosophy is still more accurate than was previously thought. Since
            the misinterpretations stem from accurate knowledge, they are deliberate, and
            are, therefore, more properly called 'perversions '. The same analysis
            comprehends Kant's denial that his doctrine at all resembles Berkeley's. For
            this just is not so. We have Kant's own admission that it is not. (1955: 243)
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
            So, in the end, does Kant really grapple with Berkeley? Turbayne says no:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>
                This brings us to the question of Kant's promise, in the
            first edition of the <i>Critique</i>, to deal with Berkeley's doctrine, and his
            failure to do so. In the fourth <i>Paralogism</i>, Kant's position is made to
            resemble Berkeley's more closely than anywhere else. We now know that there is,
            not only resemblance, but Kant's awareness of it. If he had sought to refute
            Berkeley in the next section, he must have ended in hopeless confusion, for he
            would have been refuting himself. He therefore did not even try. A niggardly
            description of Berkeley's doctrine was his only recourse. (1955: 243)
            </blockquote>
