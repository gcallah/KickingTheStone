            Hegel
        </h3>

            <p>
            As mentioned above, Hegel is another leading source of
            the idea that Berkeley was a "subjective idealist", and it was on the rejection
            of this subjective view that he opposed his own "objective idealism". He begins
            the section on Berkeley of <i>The History of Philosophy</i> by declaring: "This
            idealism, in which all external reality disappears, has before it the
            standpoint of Locke, and it proceeds directly from him." (1896: 364). Thus, he
            was a sufficiently sound historical thinker to understand that Berkeley's
            philosophy was a response to Locke's (and others with similar views), something
            ignored by some later critics of Berkeley. But he has goes badly astray in
            claiming "all external reality disappears": as we have seen, Berkeley most
            emphatically sought to assert the reality of the external world, and fight the
            skepticism about its existence that he saw as the consequence of the Lockean
            view.

            And how does a thinker as acute as Hegel miss this point? As
            with many others, it is by ignoring the role of the mind of God in Berkeley's
            thought: "we have the point of view that all existence and its determinations
            arise from feeling, and are constituted by self-consciousness" (1896: 365).
            Berkeley never would have accepted this formulation of his ideas; quite the
            contrary, for him, in confronting reality we find ourselves constantly being
            made aware of the presence of another consciousness, the unlimited one that is
            keeping this world present before us. One may find this notion of Berkeley's
            unsound, but it will hardly do to characterize it as being one in which
            existence is merely self-consciousness. And Hegel makes the same error just a
            little later: "Berkeley thus indeed acknowledges the distinction between
            Being-for-self and Other-Being, which in his case, however, itself falls within
            the 'I'" (1896: 365).

            It is interesting that in later lecture series on the same
            topic Hegel did not even address Berkeley.

                To what extent did they accept Hegel's mis-reading?
