            What Berkeley Actually Wrote 
        </h1>

<p>
Let us turn now to charge of often leveled against Berkeley of subjectivism:
did Berkeley believe reality is "all in our heads"?
We will begin by considering some of the many
passages from Berkeley himself that explicitly contradict that idea. For
instance, in <i>Alciphron</i>, he writes:
</p>

<blockquote>
The soul of man actuates but a small body, an insignificant
particle, in respect of the great masses of nature, the elements and heavenly
bodies, and system of the world. And the wisdom that appears in those motions,
which are the effects of human reason, is incomparably less than that which
discovers itself in the structure and use of organized natural bodies, animal
or vegetable. (Berkeley and Clarke 2008: 274)
</blockquote>

<p>
Do those look like the words of a thinker who believed
the world was all in his head? Or consider this passage from <i>Siris:</i>
</p>

<blockquote>
What entertainment soever the reasoning or notional part
may afford the mind, I will venture to say the other part seems so surely
calculated to do good to the body that both must be gainers. For if the lute be
not well tuned, the musicians fails in his harmony. And, in our present state,
the operations of the mind so far depend on the right tone or good condition of
its instrument that anything which greatly contributes to preserve or recover
the health of the body is well worth the attention of the mind. (Berkeley and
Clarke 2008: 315)
</blockquote>

<p>
This is from an essay advocating the drinking of tar
water for health. So those who contend that Berkeley "thought the external
world didn't exist" would have us believe that he wrote an entire essay on the
importance of putting imaginary tar water into his imaginary body.
</p>

<p>
In <i>The Querist</i>, Berkeley asks, "Whether the natural body
can be in a state of health and vigour without a due circulation of the
extremities, even?" (2008: 190) Again, are we to suppose that Berkeley was
concerned about the imaginary circulation of imaginary blood through an
imaginary body?
</p>

<p>
Berkeley himself firmly rejected the view that his own work was
skeptical about the external world; he held that he was <i>battling</i> was
skepticism. The hero of his <i>Three Dialogues</i>, Philonous, responds to
Hylas"s charge that his doctrines are a "revolt [against] the plain dictates of
nature and common sense", as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
That there is no such thing as what <i>philosophers call
material substance</i>, I am seriously persuaded: but if I were made to see
anything absurd or sceptical in this, I should then have the same reason to
renounce this, that I imagine I have now to reject the contrary opinion... Well,
then, are you content to admit that opinion for true, which upon examination
shall appear most agreeable to common sense, and remote from skepticism?" (1996:
108, emphasis mine)
</blockquote>

<p>
Berkeley was not revolting against common sense: he was rejecting a unique and
novel construction of reality which had only been forwarded in the century
before he wrote.
