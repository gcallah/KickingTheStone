           Bishop Berkeley is often thought to be the leading
           proponent of subjective idealism, and is commonly held to have endorsed
           scepticism about the existence of an external world. There is the famous
           incident of Samuel Johnson refuting Berkeley by kicking a rock, proving that
           the external world is real; similarly, over a century later, G.E. Moore held up
           his hand during a lecture, and declared it to be real, in order to refute
           idealism.

           But is this common impression correct? This work will look at
           many key figures in the long history of discussion on this question, and attempt
           to demonstrate that they have misread Berkeley. Firstly, Berkeley's own words,
           as we shall see, often directly contradict this interpretation. Furthermore, 
           there is widespread agreement amongst many serious students of Berkeley's
           work that the answer to the above question is "no": Berkeley was <i>not</i> a
           subjective idealist, at least if the meaning of that term is that the world is
           "all in our (human) heads".
           (Indeed, some prominent Berkeley scholars have even
           denied that he was an idealist at all; instead, they contend, he was a
           common-sense realist, and at the same time an immaterialist.)

           If that view prevalent amongst serious readers of Berkeley is
           correct, then it will also be interesting to investigate how the perception
           that he was a subjective idealist has persisted for so long. Therefore, this
           paper is, to some extent, an investigation as to how popular error can persist
           for centuries in the face of a great deal of evidence convicting the vulgar
           view of falsehood.
